Welcome to the Get2Good project: A project about improving the lives and reducing the stress of caregivers. Our mission is to help reduce stress with caregivers, especially those that deal with patients with dementia. Each week, we will give an update on the progress of creating this app. 

## Week 1: Jan 31

All of the progress this week was done laying the foundations and setting up our development environment. We made prototypes of the app as can be seen [here.](https://www.figma.com/design/1gdUedskheLhXUsnketNb6/G2G?node-id=0-1&t=nrxwkBqFsM3u4lly-1)

We did some minor adjustments to the database and made sure that our login page worked well.

Implementing the user survey began here.

## Week 5: Feb 28

We finished linking the user login and logout pages. We also finished the user survey page and the ranking statements page as well just in time for the demo.
