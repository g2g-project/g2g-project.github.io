Welcome to the Getting2Good project: A project about improving the lives and reducing the stress of caregivers. Our mission is to help reduce stress with caregivers, especially those that deal with patients with dementia. Each week, we will give an update on the progress of creating this app. 

This project was proposed and managed by Jake Moore (MBA, MSN, APRN), and it is currently maintained by Brayden Danielson. 

## Week 13: May 2
---
Finishing touches were made to the home screen and to other parts of the application in preparation for the ICS Project Day presentation. Releases for Android and iOS platforms are currently underway and should be available shortly.

## Week 12: Apr 25
---
The Home page was completely revamped from the old screen to the new and modern look. It has everything that the user may need to use in one compact screen. More minor improvements were made elsewhere in the application.

## Week 11: Apr 18
---
The Good Days feature was added to the app. The user is given 7 different categories with various different tasks; they have to choose 2 tasks for each category to help them define what a good day looks like. Then, at the end of the work day at 5:00PM local time, they will be given a push notification, letting them know to check-in and see what tasks they have finished off their list. The most tasks they finished, the better the day they have, which will then be tracked on the calendar in the home page.

## Week 10: Apr 11
---
More planning into the Good Days feature was discussed, but not much progress was made.

## Week 9: Apr 4
---
A resources page was added to the app containing different guides and resources to help alleviate stress for the caregivers. These resources are sorted into 7 different categories: Medication, Safety, Caregiver Wellbeing, Community Resources, End of Life Decisions, Behaviors, and General Dementia Information. These different resources range from PDFs, YouTube videos, and websites that contain useful information and are free to use. These resources will be periodally updated to make sure that they have the most up-to-date information.

## Week 8: Mar 28
---
The week of March 21st was skipped due to Spring Break.
App icons and a calendar that tracks the progress of how stressful the user has been during the week has been added to the app. Each day is represented with a color coordinating to the stress score that the user reported that day. The more red it is means that the more stress the user felt. The more green it is means that the user felt less stress during that day.

## Week 7: Mar 14
---
Minor progress was made with the daily check-in page.

## Week 6: Mar 7
---
The login/sign-in page was completed with full integration to the Firebase database. Error handling and minor tweaks to the UI were made as well.

## Week 5: Feb 28
---
We finished linking the user login and logout pages. We also finished the user survey page and the ranking statements page as well just in time for the demo.

## Week 4: Feb 21
---
Implementing the user survey began here.

## Week 3: Feb 14
---
We did some minor adjustments to the database and made sure that our login page worked well.

## Week 2: Feb 7
---
We started working on the login page where users can register to use our app. We also started working on the backend with the database and started to implement some of the user functions as well.

## Week 1: Jan 31 
---
All of the progress this week was done laying the foundations and setting up our development environment. We made prototypes of the app as can be seen [here.](https://www.figma.com/design/1gdUedskheLhXUsnketNb6/G2G?node-id=0-1&t=nrxwkBqFsM3u4lly-1)
